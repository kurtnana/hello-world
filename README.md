# hello-world

Hi Guys,

I am an entrepeneur who wishes to use the power of computer networks to connect everyone I can in the world to me in real time. What a time to be alive. I am really good with backend server stuff, php, mysql. I am getting a little bit better with JavaScript and other Script like language such as C#. I am avid fan of 3D printing. My favorite food is lasagna. Nothing makes me smile more than a pretty girl in a sundress. The program that made me an enormous success was a graphical network interface. Your location coordinates give you hotpots and applications to interact with that can affect your life in real time. Whether is through shopping, sales, retail, specialized services, travel, this interface got you. It's called Vidmer released by Vidmer Corporation.
